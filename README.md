# OnlineAssessmentSystem-UML
The Online Assessment System with UML Diagram allows users test their knowledge skills.
The system allows users to register and then login to participate in quiz. The system administrator prepares and uploads quiz and set various parameters form the quiz such as time limit, minimum passing score etc. Upon taking a quiz, the user is presented with scores and a report containing correct/wrong answers.
This dynamic process is supported by a range of UML diagrams, such as Use Case, Sequence, Collaboration, Class, Activity, State Chart, and CRC that offer a holistic visualization of the system's functionality, interactions, architecture, and deployment.
